# Proposals
Proposals can be submitted by any holder of 5 or more GrumpieZ tokens. Your proposal should consider the following:

- What is the proposal?
- How will it benefit GrumpyDAO
- How much of treasury funds are required
- A break down of how funds will be used
- KPIs


## Voting
One GrumpieZ token will count for one vote either for or against the proposal submitted.

## Delegation
If you wish you will be able to delegate your vote to the council if you do not have time to vote. This will be similar to a staking contract where you will be able to delegate / un-delegate your GrumpieZ token at any time.
